Your task is to implement the function `copy` that creates a copy of an object.

1. Usage of rest/spread operator is **strictly forbidden**
2. Your implementation should implement a 'deep' copy if some property is an object you should also copy it. (Pay attention to arrays) =)

Example:
```javascript
const obj = {
 a: 4,
 b: { 
  c: 5,
 },
};

const obj1 = copy(obj)

//obj1 is a newly created object
obj1 === obj // false;
obj1.b === obj.b // false;
```
