Your task is to implement a `compose` function that accepts an infinite amount of function as an argument, and return a new function that calls each of the given functions from right to left.

```js
// example
const add2 = (a) => a + 2;
const mul2 = (a) => a * 8;

const addAndMul = compose(
  add2,
  mul2
);

// it is important that addAndMul is a function

addAndMul(2) //returns 6 ~ add2(mul2(2)) 

```

```js
// example with extra
const add2 = (a) => a + 2;
const mul = (a, b) => a * b;

const addAndMul = compose(
  add2,
  mul
);

// it is important that addAndMul is a function

addAndMul(2, 4) //returns 6 ~ add2(mul2(2, 4)) 

```

Extras:
1. First function to accept infinite amount of args (+10pts)
