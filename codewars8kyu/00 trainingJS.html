    /*Training JS #2: Basic data types--Number
    In javascript, Number is one of basic data types. It can be positive: 1,2,3, negative:-1,-100 , integer:123,456, decimal:3.1415926,-8.88 etc..

    Numbers can use operators such as + - * / %

    #TASK: I've written five function ```equal1,equal2,equal3,equal4,equal5```, defines six global variables ```v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6```, every function has two local variables ```a,b```, please set the appropriate value for the two variables(select from v1--v6), making these function return value equal to 100. the function equal1 is completed, please refer to this example  to complete the following functions.

    When you have finished the work, click "Run Tests" to see if your code is working properly. In the end, click "Submit" to submit your code pass this kata.

    /* Training JS #3: Basic data types--String

In javascript, String is one of basic data types. Use "" or '' to declare a string variable. It can be letters:a,b,c,A,B,C, numbers: 123..., Various symbol:@#$%^&* , Control symbol:\n,\t etc..

String can use operators +, Connect two or more strings together.

#Task 
misson 1: I've create three function, and defined some global variables, please select some variables that can make up the name of the function, and return them(Please note the uppercase and lowercase letters are different).

When you have finished the work, click "Run Tests" to see if your code is working properly.

misson 2: After misson 1 finished. you should click "Submit" to see my three questions, and write the answer in function ```answer1, answer2,answer3```

John's iron axe fell into the river. He cried sadly by the river.
Then a monster came out of the water, with a golden axe in his hand.
He asked John: is this golden axe yours?

John replied that it was not his axe. The monster took out a silver axe.
He asked John: is this silver axe yours?

John replied that it was not his axe. The monster took out a iron axe.
He asked John: is this iron axe yours?

John said happily: This is my iron axe!!!
The monster smiled and said to John, "you are an honest boy!"
